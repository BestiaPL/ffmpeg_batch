It provides unlimited single or multi-file batch encoding for almost any audio/video format. You can use any set of parameters 
and try them before starting encoding. You can manipulate and multiplex streams, batch subtitle (as track and hardcoded), 
trim, concatenate, record screen, capture M3u8 or YouTube URLs. You can also access useful multimedia file information.

You can manually save your favourite custom ffmpeg parameters, using a fancy encoding wizard. You can use relative/absolute output 
paths, automatically rename output files, overwrite them etc.
